# Billy Beer Wireframe - Markdown

Billy Beer was a brand of American beer that was produced in the 1970s. It was marketed as a lower-priced alternative to other domestic beers, and was named after President Jimmy Carter's brother, Billy Carter, who served as a spokesman for the brand. Despite initial success, sales of Billy Beer declined rapidly and the brand was eventually discontinued.

Our plan is to do a re-brand for the Billy Beer Product to have a more exciting and freshly modern design aesthetics.
